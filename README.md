# E-Wear Emporium :office:

This project was a collaborative effort, focusing on selling high-quality sportswear equipment at competitive prices. I played a key role in backend development, creating handlers, ensuring endpoint functionality, and integrating backend with frontend components. I also contributed to CSS styling for components such as sign-up and login.

## Home Page :house:



Our home page features the hero section of our website, which includes our slogan: “Empower your everyday with wearable technology”.



In order to make our users’ experience simple but enjoyable when browsing our e-commerce website, we’ve created a navbar which will lead our clients directly to parts of our website our customers will be interested in.

## Shop All :eyes:



In this page, you’ll be able to view all of the products that we have to offer at **E-Wear Emporium**. 



You’ll even be able to sort through the items according to your liking. For example, you can sort through the various categories of our products, you can sort through our items by alphabetical order or you can even sort our products by their prices. 



In addition, users will also be able to see if the products they wish to purchase is in stock or not. Of course, should the item be unavailable for transaction, they will not be able to add those items in their cart. 


### Our Cart Feature :shopping_cart:



Our cart feature enables our customers to add items to a list that they would like to purchase, but that's not all. They will also be able to view each product's price tag and how many quantities of each item they've inserted in their cart. 

However, to simplify our user interface, the cart feature won't lead them to a separate browser tab. Instead, a small window pop-up will appear where they can see all the information previously mentioned, but also be able to keep surfing through our products at the same time. 



### Order Confirmed! :white_check_mark:



Moreover, once users would like to finalize their purchase, they simply have to click the _Checkout_, which will lead them to a confirmation page for users to verify their cart before confirming their purchase.  

One cool feature from our _Checkout_ page is a benefit for users that have created an account. In other words, if users are logged in while trying to checkout with their order, their information will be pre-filled on the screen in order to facilitate the process. To know more about about login features, please visit **_Our Login/Signup page_** below. 

Lastly, once our clients have confirmed their transaction, they will be redirected to a _Success_ page to confirm their order has been placed successfully. But that's not all; their order #ID will also be displayed on the page. This will allow our clients to have a reference point with their order, should they have any related questions or concerns.

Users will even be able to click on brands that interest them, and they’ll be redirected to the respective companies’ website.

### Our Login/Signup page :woman:



Our clients will have the option access this page by clicking the login/signup button, which is the last button to the right in our navbar. 



Once users have reached that page, the option to login or signup will be offered on the same page. However, if they wish to make some purchases without having to create an account, they will be able to fill out a short form that will allow them to access and buy our products. 

The catch? They won't be able to register to know about our deals and offers since they didn't create their account. :man_shrugging:
